#### How to submit changes

*Note: Other rules may apply if you're working on the project as part of a student project/thesis. Ask your instructor/supervisor.*

* Pick or open an issue and assign yourself, so that other people know you're already working on it. Pick the correct labels for the PR (usually at least *bug* or *enhancement*, as well as one or multiple of the application services).
* Create a topic branch to work on the issue. Pick a meaningful branch name, e.g. something like `issue/283-rate-limit-login-attempts`.
* Work on the branch until the issue is resolved. The usual rules apply: Create atomic commits with meaningful messages, do not include unrelated changes or built artifacts etc.
* Clean up your branch: Remove unnecessary changes, merge later fixes to previous commits, rebase on top of `main`.
* Once you're done, create a Pull Request and ask one of the maintainers for a review. The title of the PR should summarize the changes and is usually close to the title of the original issue. The description is mainly intended for the reviewer and should help them understand your approach, possible side effects, dependencies on other features etc.

## 📦 Releases

The project uses SemVer for stable releases. The release process is triggered by pushing a valid tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`) to `main`. Production is automatically updated to run the latest version.
